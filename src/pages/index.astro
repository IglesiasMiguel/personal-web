      About
    </h2>
    <p class="text-base">
      Hi! I’m Miguel Iglesias, an Informatics Engineering graduate from Universidad Centroccidental
      Lisandro Alvarado (UCLA), Class of 2025-1. As a teenager I was originally drawn to medicine
      but I ended up truly discovering this world, where logical problem-solving meets endless
      creativity. Towards the end of my studies, I led the mobile development of “PharmaTech”. It is
      an end-to-end e-commerce platform for a fictional pharmacy in Venezuela. Using Expo, React
      Native, TypeScript, and real-time data integration with WebSockets and Google Maps APIs, I
      built a seamless app experience and learned the real value of agile teamwork, user-driven
      design and attention to detail.
      <br />
      <br />
      Beyond coding, I’d say I'm a passionate educator: I’ve taught English both in a bilingual school
      setting (2018-2019) and as a freelance tutor, and I firmly believe that “to teach is to learn twice.”
      My bilingual background (Spanish native, fluent English) allows me to bridge cultures and communicate
      complex ideas clearly and empathetically. No matter if I'm developing an intuitive feature or guiding/helping
      a student through a tough grammar lesson, my goal is the same: craft engaging experiences for users
      and learners alike.
